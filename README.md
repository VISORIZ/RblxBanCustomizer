# Roblox Ban Customizer

Customize the Roblox moderation message using this open source extension.

Made by **VISORIZ**

**DISCLAIMER**: This Extension was not made to encourage getting banned/warned on Roblox. This will **NOT** edit the Duration of the ban or Remove the ban entirely (as that is completely impossible). This is just to make the old dusty moderation message look a little more fun!
## Customize It!

This Extension is completely open-sourced and free to edit the images and text!
## WARNING

It will have an error because the manifest-version is on 2 because it **WILL NOT WORK** upgrading it. (manifest-version 2 is depricated).
## How to Install
**1.** Download the *latest* version
 
**2.** Unzip it (If you don't have a zip program like WinRAR or 7zip, open the file using Windows Explorer and click "Extract All" And Extract it from there).
 
**3.** Go into your web browser (Currently, there is **NO** knowledge on Web Browsers other than [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_ca/chrome/dr/download))

**4.** Click the Extensions button located on the right of the URL bar. Then, click Manage Extensions. (If you do not see this button, click the Three Dots on the right of the URL bar, click Settings. Then, on the list on the left, click Extensions).

**5.** Enable Developer Mode. On the top-right is a switch to turn it on.

**6.** Click Load Unpacked and find the folder which you unzipped and select it.

And just like that you have installed it!
